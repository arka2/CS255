# CS-255 Project One & Two

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass, the client, offers lessons, training, and practice tests to students studying for their tests to earn their driver’s license. They wanted a cloud-based system where customers can practice tests and manage lesson reservations. Administrators would also be able to see reservation information, such as what cars were used and what changes were made to the appointment.

## What did you do particularly well?

I think I improved in detailing the system’s requirements. I didn’t provide much detail in the project’s first milestone, but I put more detail in the final submission for Project One.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would provide more detail for the system requirements. Even though I think I improved in detailing them from the first milestone, I think they could be more thorough. I think I was worried about the differences between a nonfunctional requirement and a functional requirement, and I wasn't as thorough because I worried about putting a requirement in the wrong place.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I had to consider the system design from the customer side and the administrator side. Each part of the system will have moving pieces that need to be accounted for. For example, an instructor will need to be available when a customer schedules a lesson. Multiple users will also need access to reservation information. Customers, of course, need to see their own reservations, but administrators will need to see  a changelog and instructor and car information for a reservation.

The system is for the user, so the user should stay at the forefront when designing. If a user’s needs aren’t considered, the system won’t be for them anymore, and they likely won’t use it. As a result, both their time and money are wasted.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approached these projects expecting to do lots of iteration, and I started the project by brainstorming on scrap paper before moving to Lucidchart and the system requirements document. As I better understood the system and how it works together, I went back and made changes to diagrams and the requirements document.
